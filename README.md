# Credit-Risk-Prediction-and-Customer-Segmentation-for-Smarter-Lending-Decisions

## **Project Overview**
This project aims to build a comprehensive machine learning solution for predicting customer credit risk and segmenting customers based on financial behavior. It combines classification and clustering techniques to help financial institutions identify risky customers and design targeted loan strategies, enabling smarter, data-driven lending decisions.

## Dataset Used
<a href="https://github.com/MashettyKeerthi/Credit-Risk-Prediction-and-Customer-Segmentation-for-Smarter-Lending-Decisions/blob/main/Credit%20Scoring%20and%20Segmentation.csv"> Credit Risk Prediction and Customer Segmentation dataset </a>

## Objectives

- Predict whether a customer is high risky or low risky using classification models.
- Segment customers into distinct financial behavior groups using clustering.
- Assist lending institutions in making informed credit decisions.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Environment:** Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## Key Features

- Created a `Risk Flag` variable based on payment history to classify risky customers.
- Derived a `Credit Score` from financial attributes to enable customer segmentation.
- Applied machine learning models for risk classification.
- Used K-Means Clustering for unsupervised customer segmentation.
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations.

## ML Techniques Used

- Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest (for classification)
- K-Means Clustering (for segmentation)
- Feature engineering and scaling
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.

## Learnings

- Combined supervised and unsupervised learning in one workflow
- Gained experience with credit scoring, customer behavior analysis, and risk prediction
- Strengthened skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering etc
